A few years ago while trying to build the freelance business and maybe
shipping my own electronics project on tindy and such, I read the book "grit".

Trying to see myself at the moment. I don't think I lack grit, but I struggle
to find meaning to my endeavors.

I'm not sure how to proceed. I stumbled upon the idea of ikigai. I think this
might be what I lack - some meaning.

At the moment I feel like I'm spreading too much.

I can't get myself to fix our smart home system, or get woodworking for my kid
and nephew done.

Tomorrow morning I have a call with a career change center, and I reached out
to a good friend to talk to, but I can't get myself going.

I also found a job posting that seemed like it might be worth a shot, doing
part time data engineering. Which I don't really know how to do.

Concerning ikigai, I find it hard to define things I can get paid for, or even
have passion for.

Concerning data engineering and focus - I try to build a personal knowledge
base, and add some AI smarts to it. I already have some basic system for
describing my accumulated bookmarks using AI. I wish to add a RAG to it. That
can benefit my understanding of AI pipelines I think.
