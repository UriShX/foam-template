# Daily Notes for 2024-05-22

A few years ago, while trying to build my freelance business and considering shipping my own electronics project on Tindie, I read the book "Grit". Reflecting on my current situation, I don't think I lack grit, but I'm struggling to find meaning in my endeavors.

I'm not sure how to proceed. I stumbled upon the concept of Ikigai and I think this might be what I'm missing - some sense of purpose or meaning. Right now, I feel like I'm spreading myself too thin.

I can't seem to motivate myself to fix our smart home system or get started on woodworking projects for my kid and nephew. Tomorrow morning, I have a call with a career change center, and I've reached out to a good friend to talk to, but I can't seem to get myself going.

I also found a job posting that seemed like it might be worth a shot, doing part-time data engineering, which I don't really know how to do.

## Action Items
1. Reflect on the concept of Ikigai and how it can bring meaning to my endeavors.
2. Prepare for the call with the career change center.
3. Reach out to my friend for a conversation.
4. Look into the requirements for the part-time data engineering job and consider applying.
