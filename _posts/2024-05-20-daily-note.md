# Daily Notes for 2024-05-20

Today, I had a conversation with my brother. His innovative ideas to improve his situation inspired me. It gave me a push to continue exploring my own passions. I've decided to try the "Ikigai" concept. I'm starting to lose faith in myself, and I'm willing to try anything that might help.

I had an interesting encounter at the place where I used to walk. Someone asked if I was still walking there. I explained that I wasn't currently, and they seemed curious about my status. They suggested I talk to someone who might be able to help. I'm not exactly sure what I was looking for, but I'm open to exploring this further.

On a personal note, I had a disagreement with my spouse today. These things happen, and we'll work through it.

Watching my nephew trying to walk and hearing his growing vocabulary made me reflect on my own parenting. I'm starting to think that I might be pushing my son too hard. He's probably gifted, but I need to be careful not to impose my own expectations on him. I need to let him grow and learn at his own pace.

## Action Items
1. Explore the "Ikigai" concept further.
2. Follow up on the conversation about the walking place.
3. Resolve the disagreement with my spouse.
4. Reflect on my parenting style and consider easing my expectations for my son.
