- Today, I've been reflecting on my childhood. I was diagnosed as a gifted child and my parents had high expectations of me. I was always expected to know things and was told I could be anything I wanted. However, I never really learned how to learn or the importance of practice.
- My experiences as a woodworker and an engineer have taught me that while I can grasp concepts quickly, I still need to practice to improve. This is a hard lesson for me, but it's something I want to pass on to my child.
- I've been discussing with my psychologist about my difficulty in letting go of new ideas or projects. Even though I should be focusing on finding a job and developing my career, I keep getting drawn to new projects.
- The concept of a second brain or Zettelkasten appeals to me, but it has become another project for me. I'm not just writing, but also creating a wiki-like site for myself.
- I've noticed a recurring theme in my life: I often focus more on acquiring and building tools than on actually using them to complete projects. This has been the case with my woodworking and home automation projects. I tend to equip myself for a project but never get to the point where I actually use the tools or complete the project.
