# Docker Link Descriptions

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## Overview
The following wiki article provides a curated collection of resources related to Docker, specifically within the context of financial data projects, automated trading, environment variable management, getting started guides, troubleshooting common errors, and best practices for web development with Flask and Gunicorn.

## Important Links

- ### [hackingthemarkets/tradekit: a collection of open source server components and Python libraries for financial data projects and automated trading](https://github.com/hackingthemarkets/tradekit)

	The link you provided is to the GitHub repository named **TradeKit** by **hackingthemarkets**[^1-1]. This repository is a collection of open-source server components and Python libraries designed for financial data projects and automated trading[^1-1]. The goal of TradeKit is to help developers build their own financial applications, data analysis tools, and trading bots[^1-1]. These tools are packaged in a Docker container for easy setup and deployment[^1-1].

- ### [Environment variables in Compose | Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/)

	The link you provided is from Docker's official documentation and it discusses the various ways to set environment variables in Docker Compose[^2-1]. It provides detailed information on how to use environment variables in your containers, either through your Compose file or the CLI[^2-1]. The documentation also emphasizes the importance of not using environment variables to pass sensitive information, such as passwords, into your containers[^2-1]. Instead, it suggests using secrets for this purpose[^2-1]. It's a valuable resource for anyone working with Docker and looking to manage environment variables effectively.
