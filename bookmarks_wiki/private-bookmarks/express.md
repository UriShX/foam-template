Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. This article compiles a selection of resources that cover various aspects of working with Express.js, particularly focusing on user authentication and session management.

## Important Links

- ### [Node.js + MongoDB: User Authentication & Authorization with JWT - BezKoder](https://bezkoder.com/node-js-mongodb-auth-jwt/)

	The link you provided is to a tutorial on BezKoder's website titled "Node.js + MongoDB: User Authentication & Authorization with JWT"[^1-1]. This tutorial guides you through building a Node.js and MongoDB application that supports user authentication (registration, login) and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)[^1-1]. It covers the appropriate flow for user signup and login with JWT authentication, Express architecture with CORS, authentication and authorization middlewares, and the use of Mongoose ODM[^1-1].

- ### [expressjs/session: Simple session middleware for Express](https://github.com/expressjs/session)

	The link you provided is to the GitHub repository for `express-session`, a middleware for Express.js[^3-1]. This module is used for managing sessions in Node.js applications[^3-2]. It allows you to store data in a key-value form, with the session data stored server-side, not in the cookie itself[^3-1]. This is particularly useful for maintaining state across multiple requests in your web application[^3-3]. Please note that the default server-side session storage, MemoryStore, is not designed for a production environment[^3-1].
