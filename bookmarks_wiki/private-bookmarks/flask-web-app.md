# Flask Web App Link Descriptions

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Among these are tools for working with databases, which brings us to the topic of deploying Flask web applications and integrating them with databases such as SQLite through SQLAlchemy.
