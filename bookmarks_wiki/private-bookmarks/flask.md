# Flask Link Descriptions

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies, and several common framework related tools.

## Important Links

- ### [bradtraversy/python_feedback_app: Python Flask feedback app with database and email](https://github.com/bradtraversy/python_feedback_app)

	The link you provided is to a GitHub repository named `python_feedback_app` by `bradtraversy`[^1-1]. This repository contains a Python Flask application that collects user feedback, stores it in a Postgres database, and sends an email to the user[^1-1]. The application can be run locally or deployed on Heroku, with instructions provided in the repository's README[^1-1]. It's a useful resource for learning about back-end development with Flask.

- ### [Python & Postgres Heroku Deployment](https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/0029d655269c8a972df726ed0ac56b88)

	The link you provided is a GitHub Gist titled "Python & Postgres Heroku Deployment". It appears to be a guide or resource related to deploying a Python application with a PostgreSQL database on Heroku, a popular cloud platform. The specific details of the gist are not available from the search results, but it seems to involve some discussion about changing the `ENV` value to `"prod"`[^2-1]. This resource could be useful for backend development, particularly when working with Flask, a Python web framework.

- ### [Welcome to Flask-SocketIO’s documentation! — Flask-SocketIO documentation](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

	The link you provided is to the **Flask-SocketIO documentation**[^3-1]. Flask-SocketIO is a library that gives Flask applications access to low latency bi-directional communications between the clients and the server[^3-1]. It enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-driven communication between a client and a server, and is built on top of the WebSocket protocol[^3-2]. This makes it a valuable resource for developers working with Flask and wanting to implement real-time functionalities in their applications.

- ### [Using WebSockets on Heroku with Python | Heroku Dev Center](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-websockets)

	The link you provided is to a page on the Heroku Dev Center titled "Using WebSockets on Heroku with Python"[^4-1]. This page provides comprehensive information about the WebSocket protocol, a core technology of modern, real-time web applications, and how to use it on Heroku with Python[^4-1]. It covers topics such as application architecture, security considerations, and example implementations, making it a valuable resource for backend development, particularly for Flask applications[^4-1].

	The link you provided points to a GitHub repository named `dreamhost-flask-project-template` by the user `jprusik`[^7-1]. This repository provides a base setup specifically designed to launch new applications on Dreamhost's shared hosting plan[^7-1]. It includes instructions for installation, setting up a virtual environment, and other configurations, making it a valuable resource for developers working with Flask on Dreamhost[^7-1].

- ### [CGI — Flask Documentation (1.1.x)](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/cgi/)

	The link you provided is to the **CGI section** of the Flask documentation[^8-1]. This section provides information on how to deploy a Flask application using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI). It explains that CGI, while supported by all major servers and guaranteed to work when other methods fail, usually offers sub-optimal performance. The documentation also provides specific instructions for deploying a Flask application on Google’s App Engine, where execution occurs in a CGI-like environment[^8-1].

- ### [PyFormat: Using % and .format() for great good!](https://pyformat.info/)

	The link you provided is to a website called "PyFormat: Using % and .format() for great good!"[^9-1]. This site is a practical guide to Python's string formatting system, covering both old and new style formatting with practical examples[^9-1]. It's a valuable resource for Python developers, especially those working with Python versions 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5, as all examples work out of the box with these versions without requiring any additional libraries[^9-1].
