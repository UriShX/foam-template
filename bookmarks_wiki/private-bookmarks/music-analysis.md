# Music Analysis Link Descriptions

Music analysis is a broad field that encompasses various techniques and methodologies used to understand and interpret music. This article provides an overview of several key resources that can be utilized for music analysis, particularly focusing on harmony, counterpoint, sentiment analysis, and computational methods.

## Important Links
