# Staticman_link_descriptions

Staticman is an open-source tool that empowers static site generators by allowing them to handle user-generated content, such as comments and form submissions, without relying on third-party services. It integrates seamlessly with platforms like Jekyll and GitHub Pages, transforming user interactions into data files that reside within your GitHub repository. This innovative approach maintains the static nature of your site while introducing dynamic elements, fostering community engagement and interaction.

	The link you provided points to an issue on the GitHub repository for Staticman, titled "Make a staticman app instead of staticmanapp to avoid reaching quotas"[^3-1]. The issue discusses the problem of the public instance of Staticman regularly hitting the GitHub API call quotas, as every comment on any site using this instance goes through the `staticmanapp` user[^3-1]. The proposed solution is to create a Staticman app so that each user or installation has its own quota, allowing the rate limits to scale with the number of users[^3-1].
