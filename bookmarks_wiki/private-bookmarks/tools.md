# Tools Link Descriptions

In the realm of web development, particularly when dealing with graphics and databases, certain tools can significantly streamline the process. Among these, tools that convert SVG files into JSON notation stand out for their utility in manipulating SVGs with JavaScript or storing them efficiently in noSQL databases. This article delves into two such tools, `svgson-cli` and `svgson`, which are part of a broader collection under the path: Private Bookmarks -> dev -> Databases -> tools.

## svgson-cli
The [svgson-cli](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/svgson-cli) is a command-line interface version of svgson, designed to transform SVG files and strings into JSON notation[^1-1]. It's an essential tool for developers who frequently work with SVG files and need to integrate or store them within JavaScript environments or noSQL databases[^1-2]. The CLI aspect allows for quick and seamless conversion directly from the command line, making it a practical addition to any developer's toolkit[^1-1].

## svgson
Similarly, [svgson](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/svgson) is a tool that provides an easy way to transform SVG files and strings into Object or JSON notation[^2-1]. It simplifies the manipulation of SVGs using JavaScript and aids in the storage of SVG data in noSQL databases[^2-1]. This tool is particularly beneficial for developers looking to incorporate SVG manipulation into their workflow.
