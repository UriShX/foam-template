# Definition of Giftedness

Giftedness, in most general terms, refers to an individual who shows exceptional natural ability or talent in one or more domains. These domains can include intellectual, creative, artistic, leadership, or in a specific academic field[^1]. 

It's important to note that definitions of giftedness can vary widely among different cultures, societies, and educational systems. Some definitions focus solely on intellectual ability (often measured by high IQ scores), while others may include creative abilities, leadership qualities, or specific talents in areas like music or art[^2].
